# **Project: Comparative Analysis and Visualization of Sorting Algorithms in Python**
As a group project we are looking for an understanding regarding sorting algorithms by implementing,
analyzing, and visualizing the performance of various sorting techniques in Python. 

##**Bubble Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
* Diagram methods...

##**Merge Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

##**Quick Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n<sup>2<sup>)

##**Radix Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n*d)
* Space Complexity: O(n+k)

##**Linear Search Algorithm**
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
