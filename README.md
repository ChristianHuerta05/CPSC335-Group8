# **Project: Comparative Analysis and Visualization of Sorting Algorithms in Python**
As a group project we are looking for an understanding regarding sorting algorithms by implementing,
analyzing, and visualizing the performance of various sorting techniques in Python. 

##**Bubble Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
* Diagram methods...

##**Merge Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

##**Quick Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n<sup>2<sup>)

##**Radix Sort**
* Time Complexity: O(n*d)
* Space Complexity: O(n+k)

##**Linear Search Algorithm**
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

###Libraries Used:

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
   
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create a virtual environment (recommended to keep dependencies isolated).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows:
            ```bash
            .\env\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source env/bin/activate
            ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
4. **Run the Flask App**:
    - To start the Flask server, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    - By default, the app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application. Note: The URL may vary depending on your machine's configuration.

5. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your web browser and navigate to the default Flask server location: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
